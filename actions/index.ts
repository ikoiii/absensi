/**
 * Server Actions
 * 
 * This directory contains Next.js Server Actions for:
 * - Database mutations (create, update, delete)
 * - Form submissions
 * - Server-side data processing
 * 
 * Server Actions provide a secure way to perform backend operations
 * without creating API routes.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - auth.ts - Authentication actions (login, register, logout)
 * - session.ts - Session CRUD operations
 * - student.ts - Student management
 * - attendance.ts - Attendance recording
